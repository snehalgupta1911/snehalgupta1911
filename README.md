## Hi there, I'm Snehal 👋
Electrical Engineering Student | AI enthusiast | Professional “wait why is this code running” person

Welcome to my GitHub, home of:
-projects I’m proud of,
-projects I will be proud of once they stop breaking, and
-projects that were working yesterday and are now ghosting me.

My projects run on Python, coffee, and hope.
Welcome to my little corner of chaos 🌈💻✨
